🚀 Notion ↔ Trello Two-Way Sync

A lightweight automation system that keeps Notion leads and Trello tasks in continuous two-way sync.
Built in Python using real REST APIs. Created as part of the DeepLogic AI Automation & Integrations assignment.

📌 Overview

- Lead Tracker: Notion database
- Work Tracker: Trello board
- When a Notion lead is created → a Trello task is created
- When lead status changes → Trello card moves to correct list
- When Trello card moves → Notion lead status updates
- No duplicates (idempotent)
- Uses timestamp comparison + small grace window
- Includes error handling, retry logic, logging
